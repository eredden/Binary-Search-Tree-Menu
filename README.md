#  Computer Science 201 - Creating a Binary Search Tree 

### Description
This application is a command-line interface for interacting with a binary tree.  The following menu options are available to the end user:

1. Create a binary search tree.
2. Add a node.
3. Delete a node.
4. Print nodes by in-order.
5. Print nodes by pre-order.
6. Print nodes by post-order.
7. Exit the program.

### Documentation

The functions of each of the options listed above are described in-depth below.

1. Create a binary search tree, the application creates a binary search tree with the given data (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). To keep the binary search tree balanced at all times, follow these rules: (1) the child nodes on the left must have a search key value less than that of the root node and (2) the child nodes on the right must have search key values greater than that of the root node. The given numbers must be assigned as shown in the figure below. 

2. Add a node, the application prompts the user to input a value for the new node. The application needs to insert the value to the existing binary search tree.

3. Delete a node, the application prompts the user to input the value of the node that will be deleted. The application needs to delete the node.

4. Print nodes by InOrder, the application prints the nodes of the current binary search tree by traversing it using in-order traversal.

5. Print nodes by PreOrder, the application prints the nodes of the current binary search tree by traversing it using pre-order traversal.

6. Print nodes by PostOrder, the application prints the nodes of the current binary search tree by traversing it using post-order traversal.

7. Exit program, the application ends.
